## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this excercise to recap over some of my HTML5 and CSS3 knowledge, mainly basic CSS like flex-box, the box-model
and css vars.

### Continued development

I want to continue my learning with adding interactivity to some components - pages either by using vanilla js if they are simple components, and if they are a little more complex components reactjs which is the framework with which I have more experience.
